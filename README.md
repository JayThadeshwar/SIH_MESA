# Basic Idea

Native students have difficulty absorbing knowledge in taught English. The problems they face in reading, writing, and speaking include understanding difficult words, understanding the real context of sentences, and developing a comprehensive understanding of the topic. So, the challenge here is to design a solution that will not only help them develop their content knowledge but also improve their English skills. The system includes a well-defined learning process that solves this problem by developing a strong foundation in building their vocabulary knowledge. After developing a solid foundation, the system tries to provide a contextual understanding of the topic by briefly explaining the topic in one's native language. In addition, to develop the instinct to frame sentences for better written and spoken communication skills, the system imparts grammatical knowledge to understand the semantics of the language. Finally, to measure the student's learning outcomes and actual progress, the system performs several tests and provides constructive feedback that helps students improve their language skills over time.

# Motivation

English is the most widely spoken language in the world and in India for more than a century. But still it is a challenge for non native speakers. It is widely used in offices, business, industries, and in academic institutes. So, English has gained importance in our country. But still in rural India, teaching is done in vernacular language. On the other hand, most of the competitive examinations are held in English medium of instruction in India.

Students, who study in their primary language in K-12 and go on to do their undergraduate education in English, are known as vernacular medium students. Vernacular medium students face difficulty in acquiring knowledge in the English medium of instructions (MoI).

Solutions targeted towards improving their English proficiency take time while continuing teaching in primary language MoI limits the studentsâ€™ ability to compete in a global market.
The key challenge is in developing a framework that helps vernacular medium students to comprehend the educational content presented in English MoI. 

It will not only help them to develop content knowledge but also increase English competency which will help them to compete in the global market.
So, the main objective of developing this project is to aid the students of the vernacular medium to learn and understand English quickly and effectively. Along with that they will be able to grasp the semantics of study content. This will eventually upgrade and update the knowledge, soft skills to keep the teaching learning process healthy and innovative.
